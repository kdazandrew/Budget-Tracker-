# Budget-Tracker- 
Project by Connor Mediate
My Idea for the project would be to set up an expense tracker to view all of my expenses that I spend each month on rent, insurance, food, gas, health supplies, income, etc.

With the Budget Tracker You are able to insert your monthly budget for the month lets say your budget for the month is 1,000, and you enter the code 
Next You enter what you spent on inurance, rent, to determine if you went over budget at the end of the code or if you were under the budget of 1,000 by how much.
